                        This project is <b>inspired by my time & designs at Rocket Doctor</b> and a direct

                          on understanding what elements are required for virtual health. While I can't share 
                          the research outcome with readers, I can discuss my process and show a design that 
                          takes into consideration of my research.

                        decisions. This is because it breaks it down into large <b>main steps</b>  and
                         helps <b> organize</b>  what the user <b>will encounter or see </b>  in each step. It <b>leaves out
                          the guesswork </b> when I'm producing the user flow. In addition adding the <b>pain points and 
                          frustrations</b> , allow me to think more <b>in-depth </b> when creating the user-flow. 
                          <br><br>
                          <b>For example</b> , the need to gather more info for the vet so that it's<b>less likely the vet
                           will want to cancel or request more information</b>  from the pet owner, thus 
                           <b>saving time</b>  from going back and forth. 
                           <br><br>
                           <b>Another example</b>  is the pet owner
                            won't have to wonder if their pet's <b>ailment is appropriate for virtual health</b>  at
                             the start of the flow. I also allow them to explore their options before deciding 
                             to create an account, as studies show that <b>users are less likely to drop off</b> if 
                             they <b>don't</b>  have to <b>create an account first</b> .

                <h3>Sketches, why?</h3>

                <div class="paragraph_holder">
                    <p>
                        Not every scenario requires it but with larger new designs I always tend 
                        to <b>sketch first</b>. <br><br>
                        
                        <b>Why?</b> Because while it's not the final design, and may not be 
                        where every element is located, it helps to <b>remind</b> what needs to be on the 
                        page, and what it could look like when doing mid-fi, or high-fi. It also <b>saves 
                        time </b> when doing the <b>final design</b>, knowing the <b>direction</b> it needs to take. For 
                        this sketch I've decided to do <b>visit reason, select vet & pet info </b> as something 
                        like payment is less of a complicated design and my focus is on these main parts.

                    <h3>Tones, Colors, Font & more</h3>
                    <p>I chose to make the <b>tone friendly</b> and leaning towards <b>casual</b>. 

                       <b> Orange is often used in virtual health </b>and a big company that does this is <b> Maple</b>. 
                        Orange represents <b>energy and happiness</b>. Most importantly, on social media <b> orange 
                        cat energy </b> is chaotic energy; the stereotype is that they get themselves in <b>trouble 
                        often</b>, thus: Orange cat care. I've added tones of <b>pinkish red </b>as it helps <b>stand out </b>
                         from the <b>competitors</b>. 
                        
                        My <b>font choice </b> is <b>geometric </b> as it geometric fonts are known to appear more friendly.
                        
                        Design-wise, I chose to use <b>rounded corners</b> as it also appears more friendly. The 
                        sharper the corners the more firm or formal it feels.   </p>

            <div class="textcontent_holder">

                <h3>Accessability</h3>

                <div class="paragraph_holder">
                    <p>I always choose a <b>san-serif font </b> that is <b> over 16px </b> as it's known to be the most 
                        readable for digital media. The colors I choose also pass the <b>contrast test</b> to ensure 
                        it's readable. In addition to language, it's important we <b>don't use</b> big words or <b> jargon</b>
                         that are difficult to understand. The rule is: it must be at least <b>below the eighth-grade 
                         reading level</b>. 

                        Another rule that I follow is to <b>never use the darkest black </b> with the whitest white. I
                        myself find it <b>difficult and painful to read</b>, and there are many others that also find it 
                        problematic. This is normally a problem when in its dark mode but, <b>not using a 
                        straight-on black</b> is also more <b>visually appealing</b> and <b>less harsh</b> on your eyes.

                    <h3>Is this suitable for virtual care?</h3>
                    <p>There's always a bit of concern from both sides from <b>pet owner to vet</b> if the concern 
                        is suitable for virtual care. The solution I've narrowed down to reduce the pain point 
                        is for the <b>pet owner themselves to verify</b> that their cat <b>does not need immediate
                         attention</b>. This helps vets worry less if the pet owner is coming for an issue they will
                          need to tell them that they must go to a local vet. <br><br>

                         like they have one more option could help in case the 3 vets they 
                         see have requirements they're not sure they can fill. It's <b>important</b>
                          that the <b>pet owner</b> themselves <b>understand</b> what the<b>Vet requires</b>

                        to help navigate pet care with my <b>own personal experience</b> in taking my own cats
                         <b>(Storm Trooper on the left, Snowball on the right)</b> to the vet. I felt that there should be 
                         cat-specific care online, just like dogs and other pets they have their own unique set of
                          problems and questions to ask. There was certain information even some vets weren't 
                          too aware of, like our Bengal kitten whose at risk to have a bad reaction to a certain 
                          drug. <b>Thus, I believe cat-specific virtual health care would be useful one day. </b>
