                    <p>Designing a <b>booking flow</b> that is easy and quick for the user has a lot of
                        complexity.
                        There is <b>plenty of information</b> that must be <b>presented</b>
                        to the
                        <b>user</b>

                        <b>given </b>
                        to the co-working space. The goal is to make it as
                        <b>seamless, individual</b>
                        to the user as possible while including all

                        <br><br>
                        We used previous research we've done on a co-working space that involved
                        <b> interviews, surveys, and observation.</b> Utilizing our previous research and knowledge of
                        the booking flow in our current company help make a ber case.

                <h1 class="cohubcolor">Since 2018, the number of digital nomads has tripled to 15.5 million.</h1>


                <div class="paragraph_holder">
                    <p>Before we get into discovering the flow; who are the users of co-working spaces?
                        There are
                        <b> freelancers, remote workers</b>
                        and
                        <b> digital nomads </b>
                        who want more than
                        <b> working in isolation</b>
                        in their home offices, bedrooms or kitchens. These individuals may want to
                        <b> divide work from home </b>
                        by switching locations, make
                        <b> new connections </b>
                        or simply
                        <b> don't have the ideal space</b>
                        to work. Many users who use co-working spaces fall into this category. Back when I wanted to
                        live the digital nomad life, I got recommended to go to co-working spaces to meet new people
                        that were travellers like myself. </p>

                    <p>Currently, the majority of websites
                        <b>only allow enquiry</b>
                        or
                        <b> purchase of a day pass. </b>
                        Many do not allow to easily
                        <b> book online</b>
                        . We find this an inconvenience as the
                        timely response from an enquiry can vary. However, I also suspect it is to
                        ensure the people coming in are genuine in their use of the space. <b>How are
                            we able to confirm genuine use when booking online? </b> My suggestion making
                        a requirement for users to use <b> connect Linkedin</b> or a <b> business email</b> as I've
                        seen some competitors do.

                        <br> <br>

                        Below I <b> mapped out</b> the <b>user flows</b> of <b> two major competitors: Wework </b>and

                    <p><b>Environment </b>
                        Based on <b>interviews, surveys,</b> and <b>observations</b> at
                        a co-working space we narrowed down our main takebacks.
                        The <b>environment</b> places a <b>high impact</b> on our <b>productivity </b>
                        or lack of a good environment. <b>Greenery, natural sunlight,

                        enjoy warmer environments while others feel uncomfortable.

                        <b> Community</b>
                        We found that many placed importance on the <b>community</b>

                        Even worse when it is a seat we've paid for. That concludes
                        we must give the ability to <b>select a seat</b> in case they will
                        be coming back frequently even for public seats we use frequently.

                        <b>My Spot</b><br>
                        "Once someone gets comfortable with their spot, it becomes their spot.<br> Other
                        community members identify that.”
                        <br><br>
                        <b> Industry</b>
                        “I don’t have a lot of people here that are in the creative field, it’s hard to get feedback.”
                        <br><br>

                        <b>Margin, padding, grid</b>
                        We used google material design as reference.
                        Using a 12 column grid as we're designing for
                        high DPI laptop screen. We're using 8, 16, 24 and 40
                        for paddings and margins.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Font</b>
                        Headers we used Helvetica because it's a <b>sans-serif</b> and they are
                        known to be the most <b>user friendly</b> to read on screens.
                        <br><br>
                        Font size of 14px as Poppins were chosen as paragraph text.
                        Normally 15 and up is recommended but because Poppins is rather
                        a large font itself we decided on 14. In addition we <b>left aligned</b>
                        all text (center text is not known to be user friendly) and
                        strayed away from making titles all CAPS as it's more difficult to read.
                        <br><br>
                        <b> Accessibility </b>
                        Giving plenty of spacing, <b>line-height</b> and ensuring that
                        <b>color contrast</b> passed <b>WCAG AAA</b> makes design better for
                        accessibility. If we used lighter greys on a white background,
                        we ensured that the text is bold. </p>

                        Why 5? We generally enjoy odd numbers and that's why we split seating area from seat. However,
                        it also means that it has it's own dedicate page and there's less need to scroll. In addition to
                        seating would only show once the seating area is selected.
                        <br><br>
                        In this instance, the location requires online payment.
                        <br><br>
                        We ensured that we gave the user a moment to review everything before booking as well.

                    <p>- Contain information required such as duration,

                        what this may cost them.
                        <br><br>
                        - Only include what's relevant to their flow. Have they booked this place before? There should
                        be an option to quickly book it again if they already have an account *this design is in
                        progress
                        <br><br>
                        - Combine some elements as we did with duration and guest. Select Area and seat could have been
                        combined as well if this flow was even longer.
                        <br><br>
                        - Ensure you give them a 'skip' button.
                        <br><br>
                        - Have 'view details' to hide long information

                        This project is in progress. We're looking forward to finishing the UI and conducting some user
